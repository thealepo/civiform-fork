OLD MESSAGE
    Error: Cannot add ______@arkansas.gov as a Program Admin 
        because they do not have an admin account. Have the user
        log in as admin on the home page, then they can be added
        as a Program Admin.

GOAL
    Explain:
        - Why the program admin must log in first
        - That this is different from CiviForm Admin access
        - The user won't have access to anything until they're granted access to a program

NEW MESSAGE
    Error: Cannot add ______@arkansas.gov as a Program Admin. To add 
        a user as a Program Admin, user must be already logged in as 
        a CiviForm Admin first. Please verify the user's login to ensure
        they have the necessary admin permissions to begin. User will 
        not have access to any program feature until granted access 
        to a program.
